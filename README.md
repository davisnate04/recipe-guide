While creating this application, we paid attention to all its contents and components. 

We used the [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) API for CSS. (Instead of Bootstrap)

For the Recipe Guide we used the [spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/) food API.

The page contains the following file structure: 
Main Page 
HTML - index.html 
Assets - CSS - style.css
       - JavaScript - script.js
Images folder
Readme.md

Recipe Page
HTML - recipe-page.html
Assets - CSS - recipe-pg.css
       - JavaScript - script.js
